## Learning React:

Started this by following React's Quick Start [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application)

Most of the code examples come from the book: **Pro React** by **CÃ¡sio de Sousa Antonio**

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

... then ejected and did *everything* myself ;)

To install with create-react-app with `typescript` input the command:

In cmd: `create-react-app app_name --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`

### npm start
To build the project with webpack.

### Open `build/index.html`
Open `build/index.html` to see the page.
